/*Retrieve the existing shopping cart from local Storage.
make an empty shopping cart...
localStorage.Retrieve using JSON.parse?

Check if the shopping cart already has the line item for this product. You can reuse your findById function for this task...

use findById to pull fruits
compare each fruit >0 in the cart and increment by 1 using for loop

save the modified cart back to Local storage, remembering to serializ with JSON.stringify before saving

export to array? then stringify?


Retrieve the shopping cart from local Storage and use it in redering the table. Don't forget to JSON.parse!

localStorage.retrieve again? Then JSON parse?
Hook it to shopping cart page for data retrieval instead of cart.js


If there are no line items in the cart, disable the "place order" button.

check on guess number to remember how we did this!

Add an event handling to the "place order" button that:
 - displays an alert with the contents of the cart
    JSON.stringify(cart, true, 2)

- remove the cart from localStorage
    cart.removeItem

- redirect the user back to the home page
